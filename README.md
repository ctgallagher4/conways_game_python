# Setup

Clone the repository and cd into the directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/ctgallagher4/conways_game_python
cd conways_game_python
```
Open a new terminal and maximize it. Then edit this line in main.py:
```
frame = Frame(35, 19, 10000, .50)
```
such that the first number is the number of vertical cells and the second is the number of horizontal cells. It should fill the terminal horizontally so that there is no overlap and vertically such that you can see a dashed line delimiting frames.

# Run
```
python3 main.py
```
